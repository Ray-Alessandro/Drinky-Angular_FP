This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for cocktail recipes. The application uses the [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to search for recipes and display them to the user. The application also allows users to save their favorite recipes to a list that is stored in the browser's local storage.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.
